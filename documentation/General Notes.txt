It's plaintext because, while I like html enough, I don't like it that much for changing info.

Overall Project Plan
	The overall project is divided into three large steps.
Step 1: Get the bridge working - Enable code to write valid inkscape SVG 1.1 data into a special set of Arch paper file templates, specifically from Excel Documents with a special format.
Step 2: Enable Python to do the lifting; instead of Excel, the drafting system is programmed into python and executed there.
Step 3: Allow a cross dog-pile of excel and python to be used, in any order. The eventual addon to this is a GUI, or maybe a port to C++ for better cross platform development.
Step 4: Global server like OpenTTD Bananas, or similar public forum for transferring patterns / data.
